    <h4>Steps To Making The Perfect Cinnamony Churro!</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            First and foremost, find a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to <strong>360 degrees F (180 degrees C)</strong>.
            Oil should be about 1 <sup>1/2</sup> inches deep.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. Combine the flour an salt;stir into the boiling mixture. Reduce heat to low
            and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about <strong>1 minute.</strong> Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. Spoon the mixture into
            a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on 
            each side. Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stiry together the sugar and cinnamon;roll churros in the mixture while still hot.
